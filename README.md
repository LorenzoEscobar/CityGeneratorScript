A blender city generator script, with included materials.
With the press of a button you can quickly make a set of buildngs in blender, easily customize variables to change length of spawn area and amount of buildings.
Useful for anyone who needs some low detail buildings quickly, they can be edited easily as they are not grouped like most procedural generators.




### Custom UI Panel allows you to quickly change values and experiment with different options.
